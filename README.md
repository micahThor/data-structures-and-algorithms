# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Code Challenge 1 on Jan 6.  

## Challenge
Given an array of integers, write a method that will reverse the order of the integers.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I believe that my method is O(n) time because I have to visit each element with every swap.  I don't know what my Big O space would be.  I would guess since I need to track my two variables that I created (currentLength, temp), then it would be O(n+2)?

## Solution

## Feature Tasks
-[x] Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
