## Challenge
    Code Challenge 1 on Jan 6. 

    Given an array of integers, write a method that will reverse the order of the integers.

## Approach & Efficiency
    I believe that my method is O(n) time because I have to visit each element with every swap.  

## Solution
    1. Given an array, create two integer variables that represent the beginning and the end of the array.  
    2. As you iterate through the array, swap the indexes of the beginning and the end values.  With each iteration, increase the beginning value variable and decrease the end value variable.
    3. Return the same input array.

## Feature Tasks
    -[x] Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

# Challenge Summary
    Code Challenge 2 on Jan 7. 
    1. Given an array as input, insert integer input at the center of the array.  Return that array.

    2. Create test cases to test method.  Use an even and odd lengthed array.

## Challenge Description
    Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index. 

## Approach & Efficiency
    In this method I visit each value of the original array.  I created a split solution for even and oddly lengthed arrays.
